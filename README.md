## DeansListStats
This project takes no input and just returns an ascending list with a number of semesters possible and what percentage of students were on the dean's list for that many semesters.

After displaying the stats described the user can then enter the name of any student and retrieve which semesters they were on the Dean's List

## Scope
This project works in the scope of the University of Northern Iowa. 

The files in the semesters folder were manually generated by going to UNI's dean's list report generator and copying the list of names into a text file.
